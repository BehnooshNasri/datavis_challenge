# datavis_challenge
Notes and references: 
I used the documentations for Pandas, Matplotlib and Python frequently to do this assignment. 
My own solution to find and drop the duplicates was still keeping one instance in the dataframe so AskBCS helped me re-write the code (I have kept my own solution in there and have commented it out.)
I was getting errors in line 17 when merging the tumor volume and average weight data frames so I consulted ChatGPT to fix the issue and it gave me an updated code with better syntax that ran correctly.
